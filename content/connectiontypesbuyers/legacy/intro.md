# 

The Hotel Buyers API was our first Buyers API, launched back in 2012. We have released a new Buyers API in 2017, called Hotel-X Buyers API, which is the only API new Buyers can integrated in order to join our marketplace.

We maintain this documentation as a reference for the Buyers still connected to it. It works on SOAP via http or https. A user/password is needed to access the web service.
