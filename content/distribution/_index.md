Distribution-X is the solution that allows you, as a seller, to manage princing rules, filters and blacklists for each of your buyers connected trough TravelgateX. These rules can be applied at a channel, hotel or booking level, as well as applied to specific date ranges or markets, giving you the power to configure your companyâ€™s distribution strategy in a simple, user-friendly interface. Distribution-X rules will help your company maximise benefits while growing the overall sales by managing pricing and filters for each of your customers. Effortlessly, regardless if you have 1 or 1.000 customers. 

* Define a general **commission/markup** or a specific one by hotel, meal plan, market, nationality, booking date, realease and more market conditions.
* Work with **currencies**: block certain currencies by country or allow currency exchange.
* Define different **filters** by hotel portfolio, payment type, rate rules (Non refundable, refundable rates), rate plan codes or binding prices. 
* Define **general stop sales** by hotel, hotel chains, markets, countries, cities and destinations.
* Define **specific stop sales** by meal plan, market, nationality, booking date, release, non refundable / refudable rates and more market conditions.

All rules can be loaded and updated manually through the Distribution-X extranet or using different csv files that you will be able to store in our FTP (our system will load automatically the defined rules with a determinated frequency). For detail information of each rule, you can visit [Rules Management](extranet/rules).

## Masters
