## Overview

### Hotels

From the component, by selecting filter, it lets us choose between one of the possible search fields: 

* Hotel Name
* Hotel Code
* Hotel Chain
* Destination 
* Country Code.

An example searching by hotel name: We choose the filter and its value, we add it and we can carry out the search. It is possible to specify as many filters as we want. The result would be the following:
