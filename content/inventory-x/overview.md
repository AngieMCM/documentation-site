# Inventory-X Overview

Inventory-X permits Channel Managers and Product Distributors to push their product into a TravelgateX database, thus making it available for the TravelgateX buyers.

## The way Inventory-x works is the following

Channel Managers and Hotels will push data to Inventory-X.

- Inventory-X will receive the data from the different channels and will store it in a common structure.

- Then, this product can be consumed in 3 different ways by TravelgateX buyers:
    - Pull with our Hotel-X solution.
    - Push with our Channel-X solution.
    - Flat File solution.


## I want to buy from Channel Managers

If you are a buyer and you want to connect with different Channel Managers you will need the following: 

1. Be a buyer in TravelgateX platform, using our Hotel-X API.
2. Request the activation in our [connect form](https://www2.travelgatex.com/connect/form/legacy). 
2. Once the connection is made and delivered to you, use our [Inventory-X extranet](/extranet) to create the SetUp of the hotels, rates and rooms contracted with the hoteliers so the Channel Manager can map all this information and load availability and prices for you. We always recommend to start with a real pilot hotel before going live.

## I want to sell my inventory

If you are a Channel Manager or a supplier that wants to be integrated in a push connection, you have two options: 

- Push API: Integrate with [Inventory-X API](/api-reference) and load your availability and prices for your different buyers trough a unique integration.

- Extranet: If you don't have an API and want to load your product manually, you can use our [Inventory-X extranet](/extranet).
