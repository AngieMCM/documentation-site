* **Hotel**: Hotel name or ID to request for.
* **Dates:** Check-in and check-out date to request for.
* **Packages Rates**: Check if you also want to receive package rates.
* **Markets**: Optional filter if you only want to receive rates allowed for specific markets.
* **Rooms**: Number of rooms to request for.
* **Paxes and ages**: Number of pax in each room and their age.
